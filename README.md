Keylogger
=========

Simple FTP Python Keylogger v1.0 -Alex Avlonitis-

Required:
Python 2.7 32bit: http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads
Pyhook: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/

How it works:
First it checks if there is a keys.txt file under %appdata% folder.
If there isn't, it creates one and starts recording keystrokes immediately.
It uploads the keys.txt file on the ftp server every time you run the script.
To exit press escape
